# safe-eval [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/safe-eval.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/safe-eval) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hacksparrow/safe-eval.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hacksparrow/safe-eval)

**NOTE**

`safe-eval` `0.3.0` and below are affected by a sandbox breakout vulnerability - [NSP 337](https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/337), [CVE-2017-16088](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-16088).

Version `0.4.0` fixes this vulnerability. It is highly recommended to upgrade to the latest version if you are using `safe-eval` for executing code not generated by yourself. Thanks [@kauegimenes](https://github.com/kauegimenes) for the patch.

_UPDATE 27/08/2018:_ There are still ways to crash the Node process, please use `safe-eval` only with content created by yourself or from trusted sources. User-submitted data should not be run through `safe-eval`. Thanks [@cpcallen](https://github.com/cpcallen) for the report.

## What is this?

`safe-eval` lets you execute JavaScript code without having to use the much discouraged and feared upon `eval()`. `safe-eval` has access to all the standard APIs of the [V8 JavaScript Engine](https://code.google.com/p/v8/). By default, it does not have access to the Node.js API, but can be given access using a context object. It is implemented using [node's vm module](https://nodejs.org/api/vm.html).

Currently, it works only with Node.js, and the JavaScript code must be an expression (something which evaluates to a value).

## Installation

```sh
npm install safe-eval --save
```

## Usage

```js
var safeEval = require('safe-eval')
```

**safeEval(code, [context], [options])**

`code` is the JavaScript code you want to execute.

`context` is an object of methods and properties, these methods and properties are interpreted as global objects in `code`. Be careful about the objects you are passing to the context API, because they can completely defeat the purpose of `safe-eval`.

`options` is the [options object](https://nodejs.org/api/vm.html) for the vm executing the code.

### Examples

```js
// string concatenation
var code = '"app" + "le"'
var evaluated = safeEval(code) // "apple"
```

```js
// math
var code = 'Math.floor(22/7)'
var evaluated = safeEval(code) // 3
```

```js
// JSON
var code = '{name: "Borat", hobbies: ["disco dance", "sunbathing"]}'
var evaluated = safeEval(code) // {name: "Borat", hobbies: ["disco dance", "sunbathing"]}
```

```js
// function expression
var code = '(function square(b) { return b * b; })(5)'
var evaluated = safeEval(code) // 25
```

```js
// no access to Node.js objects
var code = 'process'
safeEval(code) // THROWS!
```

```js
// your own context API - access to Node's process object and a custom function
var code = '{pid: process.pid, apple: a()}'
var context = {
  process: process,
  a: function () { return 'APPLE' }
}
var evaluated = safeEval(code, context) // { pid: 16987, apple: 'APPLE' }
```

```js
// pass an options object to the vm
var code = 'process'
safeEval(code, {}, { filename: 'myfile.js'}) // myfile.js can be seen in the stacktrace
```
